Concepts of OOPS-->

*Class
*object
*Polymorphism
*Inheritance
*Data Abstraction		
		
		
		
		
	Class--> ^ Class is a collection of attributes and behavior.
		     ^ Class is a blue print 
		     ^ we can create multiple objects of one class
		     ^ or in other words we can say that group of object called as a class
		     ^ object drived from the class(without class there is no object)
		     
	
	Object--> ^ Object is an instance of a class
	          
		
-------------Difference b/n class and object------------

	    class--> ^ Class is a collection of variables and methods
		         ^ Class is a logical entity/blue print
		         ^ will not occupy space in the memory
		      
How to create class--->

		     class (class name/Employee)
		     {
		     Variables 
		     methods
		     
		     }    
		         
		
		
		Object--> ^ Object is an instance of a class/Object will be created by using class
		          ^ object is a physical entity
		          ^ Occupy space in memory
		          ^ we can create multiple objects for single class
		
		
How to create object--->

		new class name(); / new employee();  
		
How to refer an object--> To refer an object we need variable

		
		class_name variable_name = new constructor();
		
		Employee emp1 = new Employee();

		Employee emp2 = new Employee();
		
		Employee emp3 = new Employee();
		
		
Note--Why we need to create an object for a class	
an object will aquare there own copy of variable and methods from the class
